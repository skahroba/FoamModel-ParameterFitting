# FoamModel-ParameterFitting
Python script to estimate the STARS foam model parameter from experimental data. This is a python adoption from a Julia script written by A.A. Eftekhari, see https://github.com/simulkade/foamparameters.
The optimization solver does not handle the bound constraints very well. It needs to be improved.
